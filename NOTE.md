# NOTE

## TODO

- [x] Maybe we can add a command to output only the remote script? so that we can bring the dotfiles to docker??
- [ ] should add note about the limitations (e.g., \[source\] will not work if the file not in the shittp config dir)
- [ ] Add check on the remote-side, if it don't have tar, mktemp, base64??
